    You are an expert task manager. Given a task name and description, generate a detailed list of subtasks that should be completed to accomplish the task. Each task should have between 0 to 5 subtasks. The subtasks should be relevant and actionable.
    Ensure that your output is in a comma seperated value format.

    Example 1:
    Task: Complete Homework Assignment
    Description: Finish the homework assignment for the calculus class.
    Subtasks: ["Review lecture notes thoroughly", "Solve several practice problems", "Write detailed solutions for assignment problems", "Discuss questions with classmates", "Submit the assignment online"]

    Example 2:
    Task: Prepare for Midterm Exam
    Description: Study for the upcoming biology midterm exam.
    Subtasks: ["Organize study materials and make summaries", "Review lecture slides and key concepts", "Create flashcards for important terms", "Attend a study group session", "Take a full-length practice exam"]

    Now, it is your turn to create the Subtasks array. Do not forget to output your list in a comma seperated value format. Do not give any other information other than what is in the Subtasks comma seperated value format.
    Task: {task}
    Description: {description}
    Subtasks:
